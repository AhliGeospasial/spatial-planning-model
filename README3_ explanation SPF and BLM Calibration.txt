SPF and BLM Calibration
We calibrated the Species Penalty Factor (SPF) to determine conservation priority levels for each feature (mangroves, seagrass, and coral reefs). A high SPF value more  a feature’s priority in planning unit selection. Calibration involved iteratively adjusting SPF values and evaluating the spatial configuration of results to ensure conservation targets were met. Compactness was a key consideration, as more compact conservation areas enhance sustainability. SPF values were tested within a predefined range to balance feature representation and prevent dominance by any single feature.

Similarly, the Boundary Length Modifier (BLM) was adjusted to optimize the balance between compactness and cost. Higher BLM values promote clustering of selected planning units, reducing fragmentation. We conducted efficiency assessments by running Marxan simulations with various BLM values and selecting the one that produced well-connected conservation areas while maintaining cost efficiency.

An efficient SPF calibration approach begins with a uniform value across all conservation features, then adjusts it iteratively until targets are met. This can be done manually by visually inspecting simulation outputs or systematically by plotting unmet targets against SPF values. Calibration starts with an initial SPF value, increasing it (e.g., by a factor of two to ten) if protection targets are not met. Conversely, if all targets are achieved, the SPF is gradually reduced until a target is no longer met, then slightly increased again. If targets remain unmet despite high SPF values, a reassessment of targets and data is necessary to ensure feasibility. Ultimately, we selected an SPF value of 1, ensuring all conservation targets were met without overly restricting the solution space.

For BLM calibration, we conducted multiple Marxan trials with BLM values of 10, 100, and 1000, assessing the spatial clustering of conservation areas. A BLM value of 1000 provided the best balance between connectivity and cost efficiency. To refine the model, SPF values were adjusted based on initial simulation results—if targets were unmet, SPF was increased to strengthen representation; if consistently met with minimal cost increase, it was adjusted downward. This iterative process ensured an optimal balance between target attainment and cost efficiency.
